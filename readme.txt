Assignment 2 was completed by Jaim Zacharia(s3855148) and Daniel Castro(s3485519).

No save/load function for this game has been created due to the fact we only had 2 group members.

To do the test we used a way similar to how we did assignment 1 in that you use a text input to input immediately.
<./tests/test1
<./tests/test2

Two test files have been created. These are just raw input files:
    - The first test plays the whole game and includes errors to show the error checking.
    - The second test consists of mainly errors to demostrate the programs ability to handle incorrect input.
